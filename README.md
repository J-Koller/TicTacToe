Greetings!

This serves as the public version of my TicTacToe project. I began this project in February of 2023 to serve as a quick and simple practice with Winforms.
The project quickly became a practice grounds for all sorts of technologies and experiments. At a certain point, it became clear it was to be the first project in my portfolio. Unfortunately, there were 
several commits made in the early stages whose names are...unsavory at times. I still would like for others to be able to see the guts of my work, so I made this public version. 

If you wish to run this code yourself, you will need to fill out your own local database connection string and make your own migrations. You can see the working face of my project by visiting www.jaredkoller.com
Here, you can use the web version of the app or opt to download the WinForms version. 

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the code!
